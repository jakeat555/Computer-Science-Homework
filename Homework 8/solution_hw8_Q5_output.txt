The following is the BFS traversal vertex order, staring from vertex 0:
0 1 2 5 4 3 6 7 

Here are the shortest paths from 0 to all other vertices:
A shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 1: 0->1
A shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 2: 0->2
A shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 3: 0->2->3
A shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 4: 0->1->4
A shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 5: 0->5
A shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 6: 0->1->4->6
A shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 7: 0->2->3->7
